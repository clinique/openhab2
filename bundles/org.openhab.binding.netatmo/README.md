# Netatmo Binding

The Netatmo binding integrates the following Netatmo products:

- *Personal Weather Station*. Reports temperature, humidity, air pressure, carbon dioxide concentration in the air, as well as the ambient noise level.
- *Thermostat*. Reports ambient temperature, allow to check target temperature, consult and change furnace heating status.
- *Indoor Camera / Welcome*. Reports last event and persons at home, consult picture and video from event/camera.
- *Outdoor Camera / Presence*. Reports last event, consult picture and video from event/camera.

See http://www.netatmo.com/ for details on their product.

## Binding Configuration

Before setting up your 'Things', you will have to grant openHAB to access Netatmo API.
Here is the procedure:

Create an application at https://dev.netatmo.com/dev/createapp

The variables you will need to get to setup the binding are:

* `<CLIENT_ID>` Your client ID taken from your App at https://dev.netatmo.com/dev/listapps
* `<CLIENT_SECRET>` A token provided along with the `<CLIENT_ID>`.
* `<USERNAME>` The username you use to connect to the Netatmo API (usually your mail address).
* `<PASSWORD>` The password attached to the above username.


The binding has the following configuration options:

-   **clientId:** Client ID provided for the application you created on http://dev.netatmo.com/createapp.
-   **clientSecret:**  Client Secret provided for the application you created.
-   **username:** Your Netatmo API username (email).
-   **password:** Your Netatmo API password.
-   **webHookUrl:** Protocol, public IP and port to access OH2 server from Internet.
-   **reconnectInterval:** The reconnection interval to Netatmo API (in s).
-   **backgroundDiscovery:** If set to true, the device and its associated modules are updated in the discovery inbox at each API call run to refresh device data. Default is false.

Create a `<openHAB-conf>/services/netatmo.cfg` file and use the above options like this:

```
binding.netatmo:clientId=ezezsdfdssfhdreytr
binding.netatmo:clientSecret=dshfdkfdfkshdkj
binding.netatmo:username=mail@mail.com
binding.netatmo:password=dssdsdsd
```


### 2. Things Configuration

### Webhook

Netatmo servers can send push notifications to the Netatmo Binding by using a callback URL.
The webhook URL is setup at binding level using "Webhook Address" parameter.
You will define here public way to access your openHAB server:

```
http(s)://xx.yy.zz.ww:443
```

Your Netatmo App will be configured automatically by the bridge to the endpoint : 

```
http(s)://xx.yy.zz.ww:443/netatmo
```

Please be aware of Netatmo own limits regarding webhook usage that lead to a 24h ban-time when webhook does not answer 5 times.

NB : Allowed ports for webhooks are 80, 88, 443 and 9443.


### Configure Things

The IDs for the modules can be extracted from the developer documentation on the netatmo site.
First login with your user.
Then some examples of the documentation contain the **real results** of your weather station.
In order to try the examples, you need the `device_id` of your Netatmo station.
You can find it in the configuration menu of the app (android or apple).
Get the IDs of your devices (indoor, outdoor, rain gauge) 
[here](https://dev.netatmo.com/resources/technical/reference/weather/getstationsdata).

`main_device` is the ID of the "main device", the indoor sensor.
This is equal to the MAC address of the Netatmo.

The other modules you can recognize by "module_name" and then note the "\_id" which you need later.

**Another way to get the IDs is to calculate them:**

You have to calculate the ID for the outside module as follows: (it cannot be read from the app)

- if the first serial character is "h": start with "02"
- if the first serial character is "i": start with "03"

append ":00:00:",

split the rest into three parts of two characters and append with a colon as delimiter.

For example your serial number "h00bcdc" should end up as "02:00:00:00:bc:dc".


## Discovery

If you did not manually create things in the *.things file, the Netatmo Binding is able to discover automatically all depending modules and devices from Netatmo website.


## Channels


### Weather Station Main Indoor Device

Weather station does not need any refreshInterval setting.
Based on a standard update period of 10mn by Netatmo systems - it will auto adapt to stick closest as possible to last data availability.

Example item for the **indoor module**:

```
Number Netatmo_Indoor_CO2 "CO2" <carbondioxide> { channel = "netatmo:NAMain:home:inside:Co2" }
```

### Welcome and Presence Camera

Warnings:

- The URL of the live snapshot is a fixed URL so the value of the channel cameraLivePictureUrl / welcomeCameraLivePictureUrl will never be updated once first set by the binding. So to get a refreshed picture, you need to use the refresh parameter in your sitemap image element.
- Some features like the video surveillance are accessed via the local network, so it may be helpful to set a static IP address for the camera within your local network.

**Supported channels for the Welcome Camera thing:**

| Channel ID                  | Item Type | Read/Write | Description                                                  |

| welcomeCameraLivePicture    | Image     | Read-only  | Camera Live Snapshot                                         |

**Supported channels for the Presence Camera thing:**

Warnings:

- The floodlight auto-mode (auto-mode) isn't updated it is changed by another application. Therefore the binding handles its own state of the auto-mode. This has the advantage that the user can define its own floodlight switch off behaviour.

| Channel ID                  | Item Type | Read/Write | Description                                                  |

### Welcome Person

Netatmo API distinguishes two kinds of persons:

* Known persons : have been identified by the camera and you have defined a name for those.
* Unknown persons : identified by the camera, but no name defined.

Person things are automatically created in discovery process for all known persons.

| welcomePersonAtHome           | Switch    | Indicates if this person is known to be at home or not |
| welcomePersonAvatarUrl        | String    | URL for the avatar of this person                      |
| welcomePersonAvatar           | Image     | Avatar of this person                                  |
